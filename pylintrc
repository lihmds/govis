[TYPECHECK]

# This flag controls whether pylint should warn about no-member and similar
# checks whenever an opaque object is returned when inferring. The inference
# can return multiple potential results while evaluating a Python object, but

# that case, it might be useful to still emit no-member and other checks for
# the rest of the inferred objects.
