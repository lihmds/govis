for models with model.version == 8:

channel 0 is set to 1 at all valid board positions
channel 1 is set to 1 at own stones
channel 2 is set to 1 at the opponent's stones
channels 3, 4, 5 are set to 1 at chains with 1, 2, 3 total liberties
channel 6 is set to 1 where a ko forbids the move
channels 7, 8 are related to the encore
channels 9-13 are set to 1 where the last five moves were played (if such a place exists)
  channel 9 is the most recent
channels 14, 15, 16 describe ladderable stones of both players 0, 1, 2 turns ago
  i don't know if a turn means one or two moves
  for a chain with one liberty, the defender starts the ladder to be checked
  for a chain with two liberties, the attacker starts the ladder
channel 17 are moves with which katago can capture a chain in a ladder
channel 18 is katago's pass-alive area
channel 19 is the opponent's pass-alive area
channels 20, 21 are second encore phase starting stones
globals 0-4 describe the last five moves
  global 0 is the most recent
  they are set to 1 if the move was a pass
global 5 is the komi (from katago's perspective) scaled down by 20
  (no longer by 15 as 'Accelerating Self-Play Learning in Go' describes)
globals 6, 7 encode the ko ruleset
global 8 encodes the suicide rule
global 9 is set to 1 if territory scoring is used
globals 10, 11 encode the tax rule
globals 12, 13 describe the encore
global 14 is set to 1 if a pass would end the phase
assumed: globals 15, 16 describe the playout doubling advantage
global 17 is 1 if the 'button' from button go is available
global 18 is parity information about the komi relative to the board
