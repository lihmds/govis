for models with model.version == 8:

channel 0 is set to 1 at all valid board positions
channel 1 is set to 1 at own stones
channel 2 is set to 1 at the opponent's stones
channels 3,4,5 are set to 1 at chains with 1,2,3 total liberties
channel 6 is set to 1 where a ko forbids the move
channels 7 and 8 are related to the encore
channels 9-13 are set to 1 where the last five moves were played (if such a place exists)
(channel 9 is the most recent)
assumed: channels 14-16 describe ladderable stones 0,1,2 turns ago
(i don't know if a turn means one or two moves)
assumed: channel 17 are moves which start a successful ladder
channels 18 and 19 describe pass-alive area for both players
channels 20 and 21 are second encore phase starting stones
globals 0-4 describe the last five moves (global 0 is the most recent)
they are set to 1 if the move was a pass
global 5 is the komi (from katago's perspective) scaled down by 20
(no longer by 15 as 'Accelerating Self-Play Learning in Go' describes)
globals 6 and 7 encode the ko ruleset
global 8 encodes the suicide rule
global 9 is set to 1 if territory scoring is used
globals 10 and 11 encode the tax rule
globals 12 and 13 describe the encore
global 14 is set to 1 if a pass would end the phase
assumed: globals 15 and 16 describe the playout doubling advantage
global 17 is 1 if the 'button' from button go is available
global 18 is parity information about the komi relative to the board
